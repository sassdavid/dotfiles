# Globally set options. If you have a project specific directory you can
# overwrite these globals with a .markdownlint-cli2.yaml file or add inline
# comments to your document, such as:
#   <!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD013 -->
#   <!-- markdownlint-configure-file { "MD013": { "line_length": 100} } -->
#
config:
  # Disable everything by default. Set this to true to enable everything.
  # Additionally, even with it set to false you can define individual rules
  # here to turn them on for both linting and formatting.
  #
  # My goal is to over time opt into specific rules when I'm more comfortable
  # with the rules since I have over 500+ blog posts not in git so I can't
  # easily track if something changed on save.
  #
  # That is why I didn't disable the linter and formatter at the Lua level.
